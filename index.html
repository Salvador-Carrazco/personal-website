    <p> At heart I am artist looking to add a creative edge to most things i apply myself to.
        Always looking inward rather than outward to find the solution to the problems I am facing, 
        this has lead to many and much success to my roles in leadership. I currently am looking forward to 
        applying these qualities in the fields of Software engineering and Web development.

        "Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
        You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
        It's best to step back, and observe with couth
        For we all must meet our moment of truth"
